# Dijkstra-Algorithm-Visualized-in-Unity

This is a simple Unity Program that causes a player to move around an array of randomly generated nodes and will be changed by an Cube. 

The first implementation of this Program involved the used of Dijkstra-Algorithm but there were some issues in the space complexity of the algorithm, so as I 
adjust for the spacial component, I have decided to expand this to a simple random movement algorithm with the intention of improving it in the future. In addition, this
is an aspect of the game, I am currently working on which will recieve future updates and repos that will be expanded from this initial list.
